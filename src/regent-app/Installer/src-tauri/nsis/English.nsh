; Regent: the product IS the setup, so NSIS's defaults double the word —
; ^SetupCaption is "$(^Name) Setup", and ^Name is "Regent Setup", giving a
; title bar that reads "Regent Setup Setup".
;
; Overridden here rather than by renaming productName, because UNINSTKEY is
; built from ${PRODUCTNAME}: calling this product "Regent" would point its
; Add/Remove entry at the same registry key the Regent app itself uses.
;
; This file is a COPY of Tauri's generated English.nsh plus these lines. If a
; Tauri upgrade adds a string, NSIS fails the build on the missing LangString
; rather than shipping blank text — loud, not silent.
